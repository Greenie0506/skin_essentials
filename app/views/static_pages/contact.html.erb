    <p class="para"><strong>Certified Esthetician</strong><br />

    I am a certified Skin Care and Lash Extensionist, also the owner of Skin Essentials Day Spa.  For the past 3 years I have continued my education in the ever changing skin care field. My ultimate goal is to obtain my  Master Esthetician designation. I perform facials to help my clients with hyperpigmentation, sun damage, minimize pore size, hydrate dry skin, removal of mila and give that very healthy glow.  I work with teens educating them about sun care,  breakout skin and diet.

I specialize in Chemical Peels and Microdermabrasion using the latest facial machines. Although my facials are certainly relaxing my priority is to improve your skin concerns.
